write a MyBB plugin to hook into user login, registration, post
call to Elgg API to post activity, wire
create a table to store username/ password in Mybb plugin then sync this user to Elgg
authenticate a user from MyBB to Elgg using the stored table
the password is randomly generated and the user actually doesnt know this password, he only can login to via MyBB before going to Elgg
